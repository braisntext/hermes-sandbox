"""Regression lock for the merge-time mass-deletion safety net (auditor/safety.py).

Hermetic: monkeypatches the gh-api file fetch, so no network or gh binary is
touched. The load-bearing properties: a mass deletion is blocked (server-side
merge bypasses the pre-commit guard), a fetch failure fails SAFE (do not merge),
and the threshold honours ``> limit`` (exactly at the limit is allowed), matching
scripts/git-guard/check-mass-deletion.sh.
