"""Safety net #3 — the dashboard auth gate stays locked.

Why this exists: the cryptominer incident injected 25 fake MCP servers through
an *unauthenticated* public panel. The root-cause fix was the OAuth gate
(``hermes_cli.dashboard_auth.middleware``). This net locks that fix so it can't
silently regress — specifically, that the set of paths reachable WITHOUT auth
stays minimal and never grows to include a sensitive or mutation endpoint
(MCP/tools/config-write/exec), which is exactly the injection vector.

It reuses the real gate decision (``_path_is_public``) and the real allowlist
(``PUBLIC_API_PATHS``) rather than re-implementing them.
