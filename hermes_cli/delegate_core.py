"""Agent runner for delegated tasks from an external orchestrator
(BigLobster COO -> ``/api/delegate``).

Lives outside ``web_server.py`` so the same runner works in two execution modes:

* **in-process** (default profile) - called from a thread-pool executor;
* **in a subprocess** under a per-customer profile's ``HERMES_HOME`` - see
  :func:`run_delegate_in_profile` and ``hermes_cli.delegate_runner``.

A subprocess is required for the profile-scoped path because the web-server
process is pinned to the default profile's ``HERMES_HOME``; setting it per-task
in-process would race across concurrent delegations. The child inherits the
parent environment with ``HERMES_HOME`` overridden, so its session DB and memory
land in the target profile.

Importing this module must stay cheap and side-effect free (it must NOT boot the
FastAPI web server), so the heavy agent imports are deferred into the functions.

    The interactive profile-delegate lane previously inherited only the gateway
    process's ``HOME`` (the *default* profile's) and — critically — **no GitHub
    token in its environment** (the Zeabur gateway service env carries neither
    ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` nor ``GH_TOKEN``; the token lives only on disk in the
    profile's ``.git-credentials`` and in the agent's prompt). So ``git push``
    could still work off the credential file, but ``gh`` — which reads the token
    from the environment — had nothing to authenticate with, and the agent fell
    back to begging the user for a raw token. Three fixes:

    * **HOME pin.** When ``<profile_home>/home`` exists (the per-profile
      subprocess HOME that the container boot hook populates with
      ``.git-credentials`` + ``.gitconfig`` — see ``get_subprocess_home`` and
      ``docker/cont-init.d/03-biglobster-config`` §4), point the subprocess at
      it. This makes the delegate *process itself* — not just the grandchild
      git/gh processes that re-derive HOME via ``get_subprocess_home`` — use the
      tenant's credentialed HOME. Guarded on existence so we never strand the
      lane on an empty HOME: if the dir is absent we leave HOME untouched and
      the existing fallback (the gateway's credentialed HOME) stands.

    * **gh disk auth.** Mirror the token from ``.git-credentials`` into
      ``<HOME>/.config/gh/hosts.yml`` (see :func:`_write_gh_hosts`). This is the
      load-bearing fix for ``gh``: the env-token path is defeated by the
      subprocess env blocklist (it strips ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` *and* ``GH_TOKEN``),
      so ``gh`` must authenticate from disk, exactly like ``git``.

    * **Token export (best-effort).** Also set ``GITHUB_TOKEN``/``GH_TOKEN`` on
      the delegate env for any *in-process* consumer that reads them directly
      (those don't pass through the shell-tool blocklist). Sourced from the same
      ``.git-credentials`` token, falling back to whatever is already in env.
