"""Append-only autonomy ledger for the self-remediation loop (Phase 0).

The ledger is the single source of truth for "what acted, when, and with what
outcome" — it is what makes the loop *supervised* rather than a vibe. Every
detection, proposal, execution and verification appends one JSON line, mirroring
the ``incidents/blocked-commits.jsonl`` signal-file pattern already in prod.

It also answers the two questions the Phase-0 guards need before any auto-act:
  * debounce — "did we already act on this exact signature recently?"
    (kills the retry-storm race the 60m watcher loop would otherwise create)
  * rate    — "how many times has this class acted in the window?"
    (per-class ceiling; exceed -> escalate, don't act)

Hermetic by injection: every function takes an optional ``path`` / ``now`` so
tests touch no real disk or clock. A malformed or missing file degrades to [].
