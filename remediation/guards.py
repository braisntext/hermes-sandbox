"""Autonomy guards for the self-remediation loop (Phase 0).

These are the *brakes* — built before any engine exists. Phase 3's auto-act path
MUST pass ``may_auto_act()`` before it touches the world; if it returns False the
caller escalates instead of acting. The guards are pure decisions over the ledger
plus one env read, so they are trivially testable and have no side effects.

Three independent ways an auto-act is refused, checked outermost-first:
  1. kill switch  — ``HERMES_AUTONOMY=paused`` freezes ALL auto-acts in one move.
  2. debounce     — this exact signature already acted within the window
                    (the retry-storm race on the 60m loop).
  3. rate limit   — this class has hit its per-window ceiling.

The per-class ``gated``/``auto`` lifecycle is a SEPARATE, primary gate (a gated
class never reaches here). The kill switch is the emergency brake on top of it.
