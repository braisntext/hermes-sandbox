"""Verification + promotion recommender (Phase 2).

Closes the apprenticeship loop. Each watcher tick:

  1. VERIFY — for every ``applied`` fix not yet resolved, check whether the job
     actually recovered. A fix counts as success only once the job has *re-run
     since the apply* AND is no longer failing. If it re-ran and still fails, the
     fix is marked ``failed`` and surfaced for escalation. If it hasn't re-run
     yet, verification stays pending (we never reward — or blame — a fix before
     its job has had a chance to run).

  2. RECOMMEND — when a gated class has accumulated K clean, verified runs, emit a
     one-line "promote?" suggestion to the CEO (thread 1904). Deduped via a
     ``recommended`` ledger event so it isn't repeated every tick.

Design choice (flag-worthy): success is JOB-HEALTH at the next tick, not mere
signature rotation. If a retried job immediately fails again — even for a new
reason — the fix did NOT restore health, so it does not count toward promotion.
Conservative on purpose: the track record only rewards fixes that actually worked.

The CEO still approves the promotion itself (`remediate promote <class>`); this
module only *recommends* — hybrid trust, never auto-promotion.
