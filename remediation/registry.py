"""Remediation class registry (Phase 1).

A remediation *class* is a known, bounded failure-and-fix pattern: a matcher that
recognises the failure from the incident the watcher already produces, a bounded
fix, an optional reversal, and a default lifecycle mode. The registry is code
(version-controlled, deploys via the §6 clone pull); per-class *mode* is runtime
state on the volume (see ``remediation/modes.py``) so a promotion survives reboot
and is never clobbered by a resync.

Signature = the incident's own ``id`` (e.g. ``cron:<jid>:<last_run>``), which the
watcher already mints stable-per-occurrence. The debounce/ledger machinery keys
off it directly — Phase 1 invents no new signature scheme.

Tier-0 admission rule: a class is eligible only if its fix is **reversible OR
bounded-and-idempotent** (re-running it cannot compound damage). A retry has no
meaningful "undo" but is idempotent at our layer — the debounce guard ensures one
fix per failure occurrence, and the job's own guards (auditor, git-guard) bound
what a re-run can touch. Such a class declares ``reversal=None`` with a rationale.
