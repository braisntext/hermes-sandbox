"""Pre-fix safety net for the ``shared-clone-branch-confusion`` remediation.

The fix this guards runs ``git reset --hard origin/main`` inside a *shared* clone
(``/opt/data/<profile>``, used by more than one agent — the SEO / Gap-Hunter
hazard). That command is the EXACT 2026-06-22 BigLobster cover-wipe class of
incident: a blind git operation that discarded 48 tracked images. A reset can
destroy two kinds of work that exist only in the clone — uncommitted changes and
unpushed local commits — so it can never be run blind.

Before the reset is allowed, ``assess_reset`` proves the clone has **nothing
unique to lose**: no uncommitted tracked changes, no commits ahead of
``origin/main``, and no mass file removal above the threshold. If any check
fails (or any git command errors), the verdict is *unsafe* and the caller MUST
refuse and escalate to a human. Under a clean verdict the reset is a
non-destructive realignment of a clone that merely drifted onto the wrong
branch — which is what admits this otherwise-destructive class to Tier-0.

Mirrors ``auditor/safety.py`` and ``scripts/git-guard/check-mass-deletion.sh``:
default deletion limit 10, overridable via ``HERMES_MASS_DELETION_LIMIT``.
Hermetic by injection — every entry point takes a ``git`` runner so tests touch
no real repo, clock, or network.
