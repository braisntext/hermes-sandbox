# Hermes Architect Agent — BigLobster Integration

Hermes runs as a service on Zeabur (same project as BigLobster) and communicates over the internal network. The COO delegates long-running tasks to it asynchronously.

## How it works

```
BigLobster COO (Zeabur)
  → POST http://hermes-sandbox.zeabur.internal:9119/api/delegate
                               └─ runs agent in background thread
  ← POST https://biglobster.top/api/hermes-callback  (async, when done)
BigLobster sentinel.js
  → notifyCeo() → Telegram message to CEO
```

## Infrastructure

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Service name | `hermes` (Zeabur, same project as BigLobster) |
| Internal URL | `http://hermes-sandbox.zeabur.internal:9119` |
| Public URL | `https://blhermes.zeabur.app` |
| Repo | `github.com/braisntext/hermes-sandbox` |
| Docker image | `ghcr.io/braisntext/hermes-sandbox:latest` |
| Deploy method | **Docker image from GHCR** (not git autodeploy — see Deploy section) |

---

## Deploy Process

⚠️ Hermes does NOT autodeploy from git push. Cloud Build builds the image and pushes to GHCR; Zeabur then requires a manual restart to pull it.

### Why
Zeabur's build timeout is too short for the 2.7GB image (Playwright + Chromium + Python + Node). GitHub Actions is not enabled on this repo. Cloud Build runs on GCP with no timeout issues.

### Current flow

1. Merge changes to `main`
2. Trigger Cloud Build from the repo root:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/brais/VSCODE/hermes-sandbox
   gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=_GITHUB_TOKEN="<ghcr_pat>"
   ```
   Cloud Build builds the image and pushes it to `ghcr.io/braisntext/hermes-sandbox:latest`.
   - **First pull `main` in this checkout** (`git checkout main && git pull`) — `gcloud builds submit` packages the *working tree*, not GitHub. If you merge a PR on GitHub but don't pull, the build ships stale code. Verify with `grep ENTRYPOINT Dockerfile` → it should show `/init`.
3. Restart Hermes service in Zeabur dashboard

> ⚠️ **s6 cold-boot health check.** Since the s6 upgrade the dashboard starts *after* all
> cont-init hooks (skills sync, etc.), so port 9119 binds ~20–40s into boot — later than the
> old image. Zeabur's startup/readiness probe on `9119` must tolerate this or it kills the pod
> mid-boot in a restart loop. Use a lenient probe: **TCP 9119, initial delay 60s, period 10s,
> failure threshold 12** (≈2 min grace). Also requires `HERMES_DASHBOARD_INSECURE=1` (see env
> table) or the dashboard refuses to bind at all.

### Config-only changes (no rebuild needed)

For model changes or env var updates, use Zeabur Variables instead:
- `HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL` — overrides model in config.yaml on every boot
- Takes effect on next Zeabur restart (no image rebuild needed)

### Three different "restarts" — don't confuse them

(Cost a long debugging session on 2026-06-09.)

- **Zeabur "Restart"** recreates the container but re-pulls the **same `:latest`** image. It brings **no new code** unless you ran a Cloud Build first. Restarting after a code change without building = nothing changes.
- **A full container restart re-runs the cont-init hooks** (`01-hermes-setup`, `03-biglobster-config`, …) before the dashboard/gateway start.
- **"Restart Gateway" in the web panel** only restarts the `main-hermes` s6 service — it does **not** re-run cont-init. So **`config.yaml` edits + a panel gateway-restart are safe and fast**; use that for model/config changes, not a container restart.

### Boot-hang risk in cont-init (fixed in #18)

`03-biglobster-config` clones/pulls each profile's `repos.txt` on every container boot. Before #18 those git calls had no timeout and no `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`, so a network stall or an expired token **hung the entire boot** — cont-init blocks before the dashboard starts, so the panel never comes up. #18 wrapped them in `timeout` + `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + `GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_*`. Symptom of the bug: boot log stalls right after `[03-biglobster] Synced env vars…` with no following `exited 0`. Make sure the running image includes #18 (rebuild after merging it — the running image only has it once rebuilt).

---

## Troubleshooting: panel slow / "not loading"

Observed 2026-06-09 and root-caused to **model latency, not infrastructure**. Triage in order:

1. **Edge health (no auth):** `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}s\n" https://blhermes.zeabur.app/api/dashboard/plugins`. Fast 200 ⇒ backend is alive; the problem is downstream (authenticated endpoints or the browser).
2. **Browser cache:** a stale cached app bundle shows old nav while plugins still appear (plugins load at runtime, so they're not a reliable tell). Hard-refresh / incognito. Confirm the loaded bundle in DevTools console: `[...document.scripts].map(s=>s.src).filter(s=>s.includes('/assets/index-'))`.
3. **Metrics (Zeabur → Metrics):** **CPU ~0% + RAM not maxed** while data pages hang ⇒ the backend is *waiting*, not working — it is **not** resource pressure.
4. **Volume:** in the container, `time dd if=/opt/data/state.db of=/dev/null bs=4M` and `cat /proc/loadavg`. Fast read + low load ⇒ the volume is fine (don't blame infra).
5. **The real cause (this incident):** a slow model. `owl-alpha` ran **7–25 s per call**; after a gateway restart the gateway drains a cron/telegram backlog, each turn blocking on slow LLM calls (network wait → 0% CPU), and `/api/status` (a synchronous DB query on the async event loop) queues behind it → panel hangs ~20 min then self-recovers. **Fix: switch to a fast model** (e.g. `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`). Note the `auxiliary.*` models (`title_generation`, `compression`, `skills_hub`, `session_search`, `curator`, …) are configured **separately** and must be switched too.
6. **Catch it live:** `pip install py-spy && py-spy dump --pid <dashboard_pid>` during a hang shows the exact stuck line.

`dashboard.show_token_analytics` (default **off**) gates the **Analytics** tab and the **Models** cost/token breakdown — set it `true` if those look "missing" from the panel.

## Cron prompt security guard

Cron prompts are scanned (`tools/cronjob_tools.py`). A `curl`/`wget` combined with a secret variable (`$…KEY/TOKEN/SECRET/API…`) in the URL, in `--data`, or in an `Authorization` header is **blocked** (`exfil_curl_*` patterns) and the job won't run. To hit GitHub or any API from a cron job, use the **native tools** — `gh pr create`, the github skills, `web`/exa — since git and `gh` are already authenticated in the container. Never hand-roll a `curl` with a token in a cron prompt.

## Agent git commit guard

A client-side pre-commit guard (`scripts/git-guard/`, installed into every agent clone via `core.hooksPath` in `03-biglobster-config` §6c) blocks the **blind `git add -A` mass-deletion** class that 404'd the blog for ~22h on 2026-06-22 (commit `dd0e1f5`, 48 deleted cover images). It blocks any commit deleting more than `N` tracked files (default 10; override `HERMES_ALLOW_MASS_DELETION=1`) and chains to each repo's own `.githooks/pre-commit` for per-project broken-ref checks (biglobster's `validate-assets.sh`). Blocked commits alert the incidents Telegram thread via the watcher. `git commit --no-verify` is hard-blocked so the guard can't be bypassed. The account is GitHub Free + private, so this client-side hook is the **only** enforcement path (no Actions / branch protection / server hooks). Full design: [`docs/security/git-commit-guard.md`](docs/security/git-commit-guard.md).

## Zeabur environment variables (Hermes service)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Yes | OpenRouter API key |
| `HERMES_CALLBACK_SECRET` | Yes | Shared secret for callback auth. Must match BigLobster's value. |
| `HERMES_CALLBACK_URL` | Yes | `https://biglobster.top/api/hermes-callback` |
| `HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Yes | Active model. Currently: `openrouter/owl-alpha` |
| `HERMES_MAX_ITERATIONS` | No | Max agent turns per task (default: 60) |
| `HERMES_DASHBOARD` | Yes | Set to `1` to start the web dashboard on port 9119 |
| `HERMES_DASHBOARD_INSECURE` | Yes | Set to `1`. Since the s6 upgrade, the dashboard **refuses to bind to `0.0.0.0`** without this (the OAuth gate engages on non-loopback binds and no auth provider is configured). Without it the dashboard never comes up → Zeabur health probe fails → restart loop. See the deploy note below. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No | Token for direct CEO ↔ Hermes Telegram chat (@b_l_hermes_bot) |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | CEO's Telegram user ID for direct access |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | No | Exa web search API key — activates the `web` toolset |
| `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` | No | HuggingFace token — activates `video_gen` (text-to-video) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | No | GitHub PAT (fine-grained, `contents:write` + `pull_requests:write`). At boot, `03-biglobster-config` writes it into `~/.git-credentials` so `git push/clone` over HTTPS works without prompts. Refresh = rotate token in Zeabur + restart. |

## Zeabur environment variables (BigLobster service)

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `HERMES_URL` | `http://hermes-sandbox.zeabur.internal:9119` |
| `HERMES_CALLBACK_SECRET` | Same value as above |

---

## Model

`openrouter/owl-alpha` via OpenRouter (active as of 2026-06-02).

Set via `HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL` env var in Zeabur — the `03-biglobster-config` boot hook updates `config.yaml` on the persistent volume at every boot. The `docker/config.yaml` in the repo also reflects this as the default. `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` is kept as the `fallback_model`.

### owl-alpha instability window (resolved)
`openrouter/owl-alpha` was the original model. It hit a stretch of "Provider returned error" failures on OpenRouter around 2026-05-21, so we temporarily switched the default to `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. owl-alpha has since recovered and is back as the active model (2026-06-02); deepseek remains the fallback.

### Why not tencent/hy3-preview
In Hermes, the `tencent/` prefix resolves to the `tencent-tokenhub` provider (TokenHub API), not OpenRouter. Using it as the default causes a startup crash because `TOKENHUB_API_KEY` is not set.

---

## Direct CEO ↔ Hermes Telegram

The CEO can talk directly to Hermes without going through BigLobster/COO:
- Bot: `@b_l_hermes_bot`
- Configured via `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` in Zeabur
- After adding/changing these vars, click **Restart Gateway** in the Hermes web panel (not just Zeabur restart)

---

## Gateway

The Hermes gateway handles Telegram messages and BigLobster delegation. It starts **automatically** on every container boot — no manual step needed.

**Boot sequence (s6-overlay, since the 2026-06 upstream upgrade):**
1. `/init` (PID 1) brings up the s6 supervision tree and runs the `cont-init.d` hooks:
   `01-hermes-setup` (UID remap, volume chown, config/SOUL seed, skills sync) →
   `015-supervise-perms` → `02-reconcile-profiles` (recreates per-profile gateway s6
   slots from the volume and **auto-starts any whose last `gateway_state.json` was
   `running`** — this is what restarts the gateway across restarts) →
   `03-biglobster-config` (env sync for main + all per-profile .env files, config key enforcement, MEMORY seed, per-profile template seeding from `docker/profiles/`, per-profile repo sync into `workspace/`, egress check).
2. s6 then starts the supervised `dashboard` service (when `HERMES_DASHBOARD=1`) on port 9119
   and the (no-op) `main-hermes` slot; the container's `CMD` (`sleep infinity`) runs as the
   s6 "main program" so the container stays alive while the dashboard + gateways serve.

The pre-s6 entrypoint that polled `/health` then ran `hermes gateway restart` is gone; the
gateway is now restored natively by `container_boot.py` (cont-init `02`) from the persisted
`gateway_state.json` on the volume.

**To manually restart the gateway** (e.g. after changing Telegram env vars):
1. Go to `https://blhermes.zeabur.app`
2. Click **Restart Gateway** in the System section (bottom left)

Check status: Gateway Status should show **RUNNING** in the bottom-left of the panel.

## Mounted workspaces

The Hermes container's only writable volume is `/opt/data/` (Zeabur persistent volume, `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data`). The `stage2-hook.sh` cont-init step pre-creates `/opt/data/workspace/` on boot.

> ⚠️ `/workspace/` does **not** exist at the container root. All paths must be under `/opt/data/`.

**Main agent workspace** (manually cloned, used by the default/main profile):

| Container path | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `/opt/data/workspace/FinView` | FinView repo working directory |
| `/opt/data/workspace/WorldHawk` | WorldHawk repo working directory |
| `/opt/data/workspace/grow-shop` | Grow Shop repo working directory |
| `/opt/data/workspace/bl-site-package` | bl-site-package repo working directory |
| `/opt/data/workspace/biglobster` | BigLobster repo working directory |
| `/opt/data/biglobster/` | BigLobster output files (images, reports, exports) |
| `/opt/data/cache/images/` | Auto-saved images from `image_generate` tool |

**Per-profile workspaces** (auto-managed by `03-biglobster-config` section 6 at every boot):

| Container path | Repo | When |
|----------------|------|------|
| `/opt/data/profiles/grow-shop/workspace/grow-shop-api` | `braisntext/grow-shop-api` | cloned on first boot, pulled on subsequent boots |
| `/opt/data/profiles/grow-shop/workspace/grow-shop-landing` | `braisntext/grow-shop-landing` | cloned on first boot, pulled on subsequent boots |

To add repos for a new profile: create `docker/profiles/<name>/repos.txt` (one `owner/repo` per line) and rebuild the image.

**Isolated BigLobster site checkouts** (auto-managed by `03-biglobster-config` section 6b at every boot):

| Container path | Repo | Used by |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `/opt/data/checkouts/biglobster-seo` | `braisntext/biglobster` | SEO/GEO cron (job `20ec3607f2c6`) |
| `/opt/data/checkouts/biglobster-gaphunter` | `braisntext/biglobster` | Content Gap Hunter cron (job `ce583d11dedd`) |

Each is an independent clone (separate `.git`, index, `HEAD`, and locally pinned
`user.email=hermes@agent.local`). Section 6b clones on first boot, then on every
boot normalizes the remote to tokenless HTTPS, fetches, `checkout main`, and
`pull --ff-only` — never a hard reset, so untracked artifacts (e.g. a cover image
mid-run) survive. This replaces the old single shared working tree that collided
on branch + git identity between the two jobs.

> **Operational steps (cron jobs live on the volume at `/opt/data/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`, not in the image).** After this change is deployed and the checkouts exist, repoint each job's workdir and trim the now-redundant prompt logic. The workdir-setting subcommand is `hermes cron edit` (there is no `update`):
>
> ```sh
> hermes cron edit 20ec3607f2c6 --workdir /opt/data/checkouts/biglobster-seo
> hermes cron edit ce583d11dedd --workdir /opt/data/checkouts/biglobster-gaphunter
> ```
>
> - **SEO prompt:** PASO 0's identity pin (`git config user.email hermes@agent.local`) is now redundant — section 6b pins it locally per checkout, so remove it. Also drop the `-C /opt/data/biglobster` from the remaining PASO 0 steps: the job's workdir is now its own checkout, so the commands must run there, not on the abandoned shared clone. The defensive run-start hygiene becomes (no `-C`, no identity line):
>
>   ```sh
>   git fetch origin
>   git checkout main
>   git pull --ff-only origin main
>   ```
>
> - **Gap Hunter prompt:** add the same per-artifact commit→push discipline the SEO job uses — commit each article **together with its cover image** and push immediately, one artifact per commit, then end the run with a `git status --porcelain` clean-tree check. This stops orphaned untracked cover images from accumulating (they previously lingered because Gap Hunter committed in a single batch at the end and missed binaries it had written). Same no-`-C` PASO 0 as the SEO job (workdir is `/opt/data/checkouts/biglobster-gaphunter`).

---

## Available tools

Hermes activates tools based on configured API keys. The `03-biglobster-config` boot hook forces provider settings into `config.yaml` on every boot.

| Toolset | Provider | Key required | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| `web` | Exa | `EXA_API_KEY` | Web search + content extraction |
| `image_gen` | OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | FLUX.2-klein-4b via `openrouter.ai/api/v1/images/generations` |
| `video_gen` | HuggingFace | `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` | Text-to-video via `router.huggingface.co` (damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b) |

Plugins live in `plugins/image_gen/` and `plugins/video_gen/` — **baked into the Docker image**, not synced at boot. Changes require a rebuild.

### HuggingFace egress

Egress to `router.huggingface.co` is reachable from Zeabur (confirmed 2026-06-05). The
earlier "blocked" diagnosis was a false negative — the boot check was hitting the bare root
`/` which HF returns a 404 on by design. Fixed in PR #10: probe now targets
`/v1/models` (returns 200 without auth).

`video_gen` (HuggingFace) requires `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` to be set in Zeabur. If it fails
in prod, suspect a missing/invalid key or model availability — not network egress.

---

## Skills

Reusable Hermes skills live in `/opt/data/skills/` on the persistent volume.

| Skill | Path | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `prospeccion-local` | `research/prospeccion-local/SKILL.md` | Geographic lead prospecting for BigLobster ICP. Searches local businesses by zone, extracts contacts, filters Ourense city, POSTs to `/api/hermes-leads`. Usage: "Prospecta el polígono de San Cibrao das Viñas" |

---

## Session persistence for delegated tasks

Tasks arriving via `/api/delegate` (from BigLobster COO) are now persisted to `state.db` so they are queryable in future Hermes sessions via `session_search`.

**How it works:**
- `_run_delegate_agent` (`hermes_cli/web_server.py`) instantiates `SessionDB()` and passes it to `AIAgent` as `session_db`
- Session is created in `state.db` with `session_id = task_id` (e.g. `hermes-1779505977261`) and `source = "api"`
- All messages (prompt, tool calls, results) are flushed to `state.db` on task completion
- The session is searchable via `session_search("hermes-1779505977261")` or by topic keywords in any future Hermes session

**Note:** This requires a Docker image rebuild to reach production. Sessions created before the fix (commit `ef1b6922`) are not in `state.db` and cannot be recalled.

**On the BigLobster side:** Each delegated task is also recorded in BigLobster's `agent_tasks` SQLite table (`request_id = task_id`), updated to `completed`/`failed` when the callback arrives. Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_tasks WHERE request_id = 'hermes-1779505977261';
```

# Container health probe (always returns 200 if process is alive)
curl https://blhermes.zeabur.app/health

# Richer status (gateway state, active sessions, model)
curl https://blhermes.zeabur.app/api/status

# Manual delegate (from BigLobster or any service in same Zeabur project)
curl -X POST http://hermes-sandbox.zeabur.internal:9119/api/delegate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_id": "test-001",
    "prompt": "List files in /opt/data/workspace/biglobster and return a summary.",
    "webhook_url": "https://biglobster.top/api/hermes-callback"
  }'
# Expected: {"task_id":"test-001","status":"accepted"}
```

---

## Startup log verification

After every Zeabur restart, confirm these lines appear in the logs (s6-overlay format
since the 2026-06 upgrade — the old `[entrypoint] …` lines are gone):

```
[03-biglobster] Synced env vars into /opt/data/.env
[03-biglobster] Synced env vars into /opt/data/profiles/grow-shop/.env
[03-biglobster] config.yaml keys already current   (or "Reconciled config.yaml keys")
[03-biglobster] Seeded profiles/grow-shop/repos.txt   (first boot after image update only)
[03-biglobster] Pulling braisntext/grow-shop-api      (or "Cloning …" on first boot)
[03-biglobster] Pulling braisntext/grow-shop-landing
[03-biglobster] Egress openrouter.ai: 200
[03-biglobster] Egress router.huggingface.co: 200   (or FAIL if Zeabur blocks it)
[startup] Model: openrouter/owl-alpha | Provider: openrouter | API key present: True
```

The native gateway reconciler (cont-init `02`) logs one line per profile, e.g.
`reconcile … default … started` (or `registered` if its last state wasn't `running`).
**The gateway should come up automatically** because the volume's `gateway_state.json`
already records `running`. If — only on the very first upgrade boot — it comes up
`registered`/down instead, click **Restart Gateway** once in the web panel; it self-heals
on every subsequent restart.

If `API key present: False` or `Provider resolution FAILED` → check `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in Zeabur Variables.

## Incident log

### 2026-06-11 — Orphan gateway on Zeabur K8s, root-caused and fixed (PR #23)

The recurring "gateway won't start / `Telegram bot token already in use (PID NNNN)`"
crash loop was root-caused and fixed in code.

**Root cause:** `detect_service_manager()` only returned `"s6"` when `is_container()` was
true. On Zeabur K8s `is_container()` returns **False** (no `/.dockerenv`, no docker cgroup
markers), so it fell back to `"none"` and `hermes gateway start/restart` ran the gateway as
a **raw, unsupervised subprocess**. That process detached into an orphan, held the Telegram
token across restarts, and blocked the real s6-supervised gateway from connecting.

**Fix (`fix(container): detect s6 on K8s …`, PR #23, merged to main):**
- `hermes_cli/service_manager.py` — `detect_service_manager()` now returns `"s6"` whenever
  `_s6_running()` is true (PID 1 is `s6-svscan` **and** `/run/s6/basedir` exists), no longer
  gated on `is_container()`. So `hermes gateway start/stop/restart` now route through
  `s6-svc` on Zeabur instead of spawning an unsupervised orphan.
- `hermes_constants.py` — `is_container()` also detects K8s via
  `/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount` (belt-and-suspenders for other callers).
- Verified in prod: `detect_service_manager() == "s6"` even though `is_container() == False`.

**The shared-token architecture (confirmed during this incident).** default, grow-shop and
finview profiles **share one Telegram bot token** — proven because grow-shop's gateway (the
orphan, PID 31026) held the exact scoped lock default needed (the lock path is
`{scope}-sha256(token)[:16].lock`). Telegram allows one `getUpdates` poller per token, so the
model is **one bot, one poller**:
- **default** is the sole Telegram gateway — it polls, runs cron (all jobs are `profile:None`),
  and routes inbound by forum topic (`telegram.extra.group_topics`: thread 2→default,
  3→grow-shop, 61→finview).
- **grow-shop / finview** gateways must stay **down**. Their `gateway_state.json` is
  `stopped`/`startup_failed`, so `container_boot.py` registers them down and never auto-starts
  them (only `running` auto-starts). Do **not** `s6-svc -u` them — a second poller on the
  shared token just crash-loops on the lock.

**Recovery (Zeabur panel terminal, root):** `export PATH=/command:$PATH;
s6-svc -u /run/service/gateway-default`. The healthy gateway writes `gateway_state=running`
itself, so it auto-starts on the next container restart. (s6 tools live in `/command/`, not on
PATH.) Footgun still open: clicking dashboard "Start Gateway" for grow-shop/finview starts a
poller that fails the shared-token lock and s6 restart-loops it ~every 3 s — harmless to
default but noisy. Permanent guard would be to disable the telegram platform in those
profiles' configs.

### 2026-06-08 — Cron jobs delivering to the old DM after the profiles migration

Pre-migration BigLobster cron jobs (Content Gap Hunter, SEO Health Check, Repo Backup,
Weekly Audit) kept posting to the old private DM (`telegram chat 178351069`) instead of the
new forum group, and PRs were failing. Root causes, in order of discovery:

1. **Outbound home channel never repointed.** The migration added inbound
   `telegram.extra.group_topics` routing but left `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL` in `/opt/data/.env`
   pointing at the old DM. Fixed: `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=-1004224848555` +
   `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_THREAD_ID=2` (BigLobster HQ topic).
2. **Frozen cron `origin`.** Jobs store the chat/thread captured at create time; with
   `deliver=origin` (or even `deliver=telegram`, since the scheduler returns a telegram
   `origin` before consulting the home channel) they ignore config. Fixed: set
   `deliver=telegram` + `origin=null` on the affected jobs so routing resolves at fire time.
3. **Dead hardcoded PAT.** A fine-grained GitHub PAT was pasted in plaintext in the Content
   Gap Hunter prompt; it was revoked in the 2026-06-05 secret rotation → every PR 401'd.
   Fixed: scrubbed the token, switched to a git credential helper backed by env
   `$GITHUB_TOKEN` in the `hermes` user's `~/.gitconfig` (`/opt/data/home/.gitconfig`).

**Two lessons worth not repeating:**

- **Run cron + `.env` edits as the `hermes` user, never root.** The gateway runs as `hermes`.
  Editing `/opt/data/cron/jobs.json` or `.env` as root (via `python3`, `sed -i`, or
  `hermes cron run/tick`) replaces the file with a **root-owned 0600** file. The gateway then
  can't read/write it and the **cron scheduler silently fires nothing** (tick errors are
  debug-level; `Cron ticker started` still logs, masking it). `hermes cron status` run as root
  still looks healthy. Recovery: `chown hermes:hermes /opt/data/.env && chown -R hermes:hermes
  /opt/data/cron`, then restart the gateway. Always wrap cron CLI/file edits in
  `su hermes -c '...'`. Verify auto-fire (not foreground `cron tick`): `su hermes -c 'hermes
  cron run <id>'`, wait 80s, confirm `last_run_at` advanced **and** `jobs.json` is still
  `hermes`-owned. Gateway Python logs are in `/opt/data/logs/gateway.log` (the s6
  `gateways/default/current` only holds the startup banner).
- **When migrating the Telegram bot/forum, repoint `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL`
  (+ `_THREAD_ID`) — not just `group_topics`.** `group_topics` is inbound-only; the home
  channel drives all outbound (cron + proactive delegate callbacks/alerts).

Also surfaced/fixed: the live gateway was an unsupervised orphan from a manual `gateway
restart` (s6 `gateway-default` was stuck `down`, "already running"); killed it so s6 took
over. The recycle-autostart fragility (graceful shutdown → `draining` → no autostart) is
tracked separately. The Repo Backup job had its bash pasted into the `script` field (which
expects a filename under `/opt/data/scripts/`) → "Script not found" every run; fixed by
writing `scripts/backup-repo.sh` and setting `script: backup-repo.sh`.

### 2026-06-02 — Upstream upgrade (v0.13.0 → v2026.5.29.x) + tini→s6-overlay

Merged ~1,980 upstream commits (`hermes-upstream-upgrade` branch) and folded in the
profile-scoped `/api/delegate` work (1a). Key changes affecting ops:

1. **tini → s6-overlay.** The container ENTRYPOINT is now `/init`; the old
   `docker/entrypoint.sh` is a deprecated upstream shim. Bootstrap (UID remap, chown,
   config/SOUL seed, skills sync) runs in `docker/stage2-hook.sh` via cont-init `01`.
2. **Our env-patching re-homed** out of `entrypoint.sh` into a new additive
   `docker/cont-init.d/03-biglobster-config` (env sync, config key enforcement, MEMORY
   seed, egress check). Logs now prefixed `[03-biglobster]`, not `[entrypoint]`.
3. **Gateway autostart is now native** (`container_boot.py`, cont-init `02`): restored from
   the volume's `gateway_state.json` instead of an entrypoint `/health`-poll loop.
4. **Dashboard is a supervised s6 service**; `config.yaml` first-boot seed source switched to
   `docker/config.yaml`; `/api/delegate` moved into the shared `dashboard_auth/public_paths.py`
   allowlist (covers both the session-token and OAuth gates).
5. **Config schema migrated v23 → v25** automatically on boot (non-destructive, additive).

Verified pre-deploy: 476 tests green (image_gen, web_server/delegate/callback-auth/host-header,
container_boot) + config-migration smoke.

**Deploy gotchas hit during rollout (all resolved — read before the next deploy):**
1. **Stale build context.** Merging the PR on GitHub isn't enough — `gcloud builds submit`
   tars the local working tree. The first build shipped pre-upgrade code because `main`
   wasn't pulled. Always `git checkout main && git pull` first; verify `grep ENTRYPOINT
   Dockerfile` shows `/init`.
2. **Dashboard refuses to bind** without `HERMES_DASHBOARD_INSECURE=1` — the new OAuth gate
   engages on the `0.0.0.0` bind and there's no auth provider configured. Added that Zeabur var.
   (Restores the old image's posture, which auto-ran insecure on non-loopback binds.)
3. **Health-check restart loop.** Under s6 the dashboard binds ~20–40s into boot (after
   cont-init), later than the old image, so Zeabur's tight probe killed the pod mid-boot.
   Fixed by a lenient probe (TCP 9119, initial delay 60s, failure threshold 12).

Post-deploy verified live: v0.15.1, gateway RUNNING, Telegram OK, `/api/delegate` with
`profile:"grow-shop"` → `accepted`. Known issue unchanged: HF egress blocked (video_gen).

### 2026-05-23 — Crash loop after OpenRouter 403

**Symptom:** Container entered crash loop. Zeabur killed each pod seconds after `Started container hermes-sandbox`. Started after an OpenRouter HTTP 403 "Key limit exceeded" event; quota was increased but bot never recovered.

**Root causes found and fixed:**

1. **`_is_accepted_host()` wrong check order** (`hermes_cli/web_server.py`): When bound to `0.0.0.0`, Zeabur health probes use HTTP/1.0 (no `Host` header). The function returned 403 because the empty-host guard fired before the `0.0.0.0` bypass. Fixed by moving the `0.0.0.0` check to the top. Added `/health` endpoint as a dedicated probe target.

2. **Silent entrypoint failure for string-format `model` in config.yaml** (`docker/entrypoint.sh`): `cfg.setdefault("model", {})["default"] = value` raises `TypeError` when `cfg["model"]` is a plain string (as it is on the persistent volume from previous deploys). Error was swallowed by `except Exception`. Fixed by type-checking `model_val` and handling both string and dict formats explicitly.

3. **Startup pre-flight logging added** (`gateway/run.py`): Non-fatal log block before `runner.start()` that prints model, provider, and API key presence — makes misconfiguration visible in Zeabur logs immediately on startup without waiting for a first message.

**Resolution:** Rebuilt image, pushed to GHCR, restarted Zeabur service. Container stabilised on first boot.

### 2026-05-23 — Tools activation (web, image_gen, video_gen)

**Changes shipped:**

1. **Gateway auto-start** (`docker/entrypoint.sh`): After launching the dashboard in background, entrypoint polls `/health` (1s intervals, 30s timeout) then calls `hermes gateway restart` automatically. No manual "Restart Gateway" click needed after container restarts.

2. **Web tool (Exa)**: `EXA_API_KEY` added to entrypoint inject list. `web.backend=exa` forced into persistent `config.yaml` on every boot.

3. **image_gen (OpenRouter)**: New plugin `plugins/image_gen/openrouter/` using `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (already present) + `openrouter.ai/api/v1/images/generations`. Default model: `black-forest-labs/flux.2-klein-4b` (~$0.014/image). HuggingFace plugin was attempted first but Zeabur blocks `router.huggingface.co` egress.

4. **video_gen (HuggingFace)**: New plugin `plugins/video_gen/huggingface/` using `damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b` via `router.huggingface.co`. Note: stable-video-diffusion (SVD) is image-to-video only and not on HF free Serverless tier.

5. **Persistent config override** (`docker/entrypoint.sh`): `docker/config.yaml` is only seeded to the persistent volume on first boot. Added a boot-time patch that forces `web.backend`, `image_gen.provider`, and `video_gen.provider` into the volume's `config.yaml` on every restart.

6. **Egress diagnostics**: Entrypoint now logs HTTP status for `openrouter.ai` and `router.huggingface.co` on every boot, making Zeabur egress blocks immediately visible in container logs.

7. **`_ASPECT_TO_SIZE` / `response_format` fix** (`plugins/image_gen/openrouter/`): FLUX models on OpenRouter don't accept `response_format` or non-standard sizes. Payload simplified to `{model, prompt, n, size: "1024x1024"}`. Response parser now prefers `url` field (OpenRouter default) over `b64_json`.

### 2026-05-23 — OpenRouter plugin: switch to chat completions + grok-imagine

**Root cause**: `/api/v1/images/generations` endpoint broken/404 on OpenRouter.

**Changes applied in container then synced to repo:**
1. **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/images/generations` → `/api/v1/chat/completions`
2. **Payload**: `{model, prompt, n, size}` → `{model, modalities: ["image"], messages: [{role: user, content: prompt}]}`
3. **Default model**: `black-forest-labs/flux.2-klein-4b` → `x-ai/grok-imagine-image-quality`
4. **Response parsing**: `data[0].url` → `choices[0].message.images[0].image_url.url` (base64 data URL — strip `data:image/png;base64,` prefix, save to cache)
5. **docker/config.yaml**: added `image_gen.openrouter.model: x-ai/grok-imagine-image-quality`
6. **FLUX models** kept in catalog as selectable fallbacks

### 2026-05-23 — Image gen plugin audit & test coverage

1. **Dead code removed** (`plugins/image_gen/openrouter/`): `_ASPECT_TO_SIZE` dict was defined but never used (size is hardcoded `1024x1024` per FLUX OpenRouter limitation). Removed to keep the plugin clean.

2. **`plugin.yaml` corrected** (`plugins/image_gen/openrouter/`): Description still said "FLUX-schnell" but the active default model is `flux.2-klein-4b`. Updated.

3. **New test suites added**:
   - `tests/plugins/image_gen/test_openrouter_provider.py` — 17 tests covering metadata, availability, model resolution, generate (URL path, b64 path, API errors, network error, parse error, payload shape, aspect ratios), and registration.
   - `tests/plugins/image_gen/test_huggingface_provider.py` — 16 tests covering metadata, availability, model resolution, generate (successful save, 503 cold-start, API errors, network error, URL pattern, auth header, aspect ratios), and registration.

4. **Existing test fixes** (`tests/plugins/image_gen/test_openai_provider.py`, `test_openai_codex_provider.py`): 9 tests were failing due to missing `openai` package in the dev environment. Fixed by injecting a `MagicMock` into `sys.modules["openai"]` via pytest fixtures — tests now pass without requiring the optional `openai` package installed.
