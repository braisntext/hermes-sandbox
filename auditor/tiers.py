"""Risk-tiering for the auditor: classify a PR's changed files.

Two tiers drive how hard the auditor reviews and which model it spends:

  * ``system``  — code/config that can break Hermes itself or a profile's runtime.
                  Deep review with the strong paid model; hard gate.
  * ``content`` — docs, website copy, marketing/blog assets. Light review with the
                  cheap model; the existing asset guards already cover the
                  catastrophic case (the cover-wipe).

Policy is **fail-safe toward more review**: a PR is ``system`` if ANY changed file
matches a system pattern, OR if any file matches neither list (unknown => treat as
system). It is ``content`` only when EVERY changed file is recognisably content.
A weak gate that rubber-stamps unknown paths is worse than an over-eager one.

The lists are deliberately path-prefix / suffix based (no real globbing) so the
classification is obvious and cheap to reason about. Tune them in one place here.

SCOPE (Phase 4): the original globs below are tuned for the ``hermes-sandbox``
engine repo and are used when ``classify`` is called with no repo (or with the
engine slug). Profile repos (biglobster, FinView, grow-shop-*, SocialAgenda) are
LIVE production — including the biglobster.top revenue site — so they get a
SEPARATE, deliberately NARROW content allowlist (``_is_content_profile``): prose,
static assets, and a few verified publish dirs are content; everything else is
``system``. A misclassification on a profile repo can therefore only over-review,
never wrong-auto-merge a live site. Add a repo's safe publish dirs to
``_REPO_EXTRA_CONTENT_DIRS`` only after confirming they hold articles/assets, not
templates/build/source.
